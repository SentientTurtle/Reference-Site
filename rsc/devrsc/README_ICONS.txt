EVE Online generic icon export

Naming convention:
* "[icon_id].png";
e.g.
* "26.png" for icon 26; "Commodity Construction Blocks"

Notes:
* Only includes icons with a defined iconID; Other game image resources are not included. This is subject to change.
* Icons have varying sizes, for web use, <img> size should be explicitly specified. It may be desirable to specify only maximum sizes, or use pixelated image-rendering.
* Icons are all in PNG format. JPG-originals have been converted to PNG for consistency.
