EVE Online item-type render export

Naming convention follows that of the (now-deprecated) official Image-Export-Collection:
* For regular types "[type_id]_512.jpg";
e.g.
* "648_512.jpg" for the 'Badger' ship (typeID 648)

Notes:
* Renders are not guaranteed to be 512x512 pixels, and may be larger for types where higher resolutions are available.
  Currently, all sizes are 512x512
  For web use, <img> size must be explicitly specified.
* Renders are all in JPG format, directly from the game files; No originals are available.
* Only 'published' types are included, this may change in the future
* Not all types have a render, an index is available in "index.json" within the zip file
